node_readme_updated = """# Fever Tracker Web App (PC Version)

This is the **web app version (for PC)** of my Fever Tracker project.  
The original project was first built in **Python**, where it logged data into Excel and plotted fever charts.  
Later, I extended it into this web-based version using React, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Features
- Form for entering temperature, feeling, medicine, and notes.
- Table to display log entries.
- Temperature vs. time chart.
- Built with React + Vite + TypeScript.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (download from https://nodejs.org)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Running the App
1. Extract the project folder (if it is in zip format).
2. Open a terminal in the `fever-tracker` folder (where `package.json` is located).
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Always show details

Copy code
npm run dev
Open the link shown in the terminal, usually http://localhost:5173.

Building for Production
To create an optimized build of the app:

bash
Always show details

Copy code
npm run build
This will create a dist/ folder with static files that can be deployed.

Converting to an Android APK (Optional)
You can wrap this web app into a native Android APK using Capacitor.

Install Capacitor in your project:

bash
Always show details

Copy code
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npm install @capacitor/android
npx cap init
Build the web app:

bash
Always show details

Copy code
npm run build
This creates a dist/ folder.

Copy the build into the Capacitor project:

bash
Always show details

Copy code
npx cap copy
npx cap open android
Android Studio will open. From there, build the APK:

Go to Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s).

The APK can be installed on an Android phone.

Project Background
Original version was made in Python (Excel logging + Matplotlib plots).

This is the web app version (for PC browsers), providing a frontend for easier interaction.

As an experiment, it can also be wrapped into an Android APK using Capacitor.

Aditya, I’ve updated the README to clearly state that this is the web app version (for PC) and that the original was first built in Python.
